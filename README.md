# Data Science Business Projects

## This Repo Consists of `3` Real Business Cases Projects:
  1. `Loan Prosper` Project: For this project I'll select 14 variables that I'll use to find factors that affects borrowerAPR and loanStatus.
  2. `Customer Churn`: For this project The team needs to understand better the situation, which employees are more likely to leave, and why. Once it is clear what variables impact employee churn, you can present your findings along with your ideas on how to attack the problem.
  3. `Predict Housing Price`: For this project, I investigated the most effective factors of the house price, and try to Predict the coming one price.
